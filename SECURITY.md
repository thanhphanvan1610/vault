# Security Documentation - FortressPass Web

## Overview

FortressPass Web is built on the foundational principle of **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**. This document provides a comprehensive technical analysis of the security model, cryptographic implementation, and threat mitigation strategies.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Architecture
The server acts solely as a synchronization mechanism for encrypted data blobs. At no point can the server:
- Access plaintext passwords or vault data
- Derive or recover the Master Password
- Decrypt any user data, even with full server access
- Perform any operations on behalf of users without client-side decryption

### 2. Client-Side Cryptographic Sanctuary
All sensitive cryptographic operations occur exclusively in the user's browser:
- Key derivation from Master Password
- Encryption and decryption of vault data
- Password generation and strength analysis
- WebAuthn key wrapping/unwrapping

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Key Derivation Function (KDF)
```
Algorithm: Argon2id
Memory: 64MB (67,108,864 bytes)
Iterations: 3
Parallelism: 1 (browser constraint)
Output Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
Salt Length: 16 bytes (128 bits, cryptographically random)
```

**Implementation**: Uses libsodium-wrappers WebAssembly for native performance and security.

**Security Rationale**: Argon2id is the winner of the Password Hashing Competition and provides:
- Resistance to GPU-based attacks through memory-hard operations
- Protection against time-memory trade-off attacks
- Side-channel attack resistance

### Authenticated Encryption
```
Algorithm: XChaCha20-Poly1305
Cipher: XChaCha20 (extended nonce ChaCha20)
Authentication: Poly1305 MAC
Key Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
Nonce Length: 24 bytes (192 bits, cryptographically random per encryption)
```

**Security Features**:
- **Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)**: Prevents tampering
- **Large Nonce Space**: 192-bit nonces eliminate collision concerns
- **Quantum Resistance**: ChaCha20 family believed to be quantum-resistant
- **Timing Attack Immunity**: Constant-time implementation

### Data Structure Security
```json
{
  "encrypted_vault": "base64(nonce + ciphertext + auth_tag)",
  "salt": "base64(random_128_bits)"
}
```

Each vault encryption uses:
1. **Fresh Random Nonce**: Generated per encryption operation
2. **Authentication Tag**: Validates ciphertext integrity
3. **Unique Salt**: Per-user salt for key derivation

## Database Schema & Security

### Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_vaults (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  encrypted_vault text NOT NULL,           -- Encrypted JSON blob
  salt text NOT NULL,                      -- Base64 encoded salt
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### Read Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own vault"
  ON user_vaults
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Insert Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own vault"
  ON user_vaults
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Update Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own vault"
  ON user_vaults
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Security Guarantees**:
- Users can only access their own encrypted vault
- Database-level enforcement prevents lateral movement
- No DELETE policy prevents accidental data loss
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp tracking

## WebAuthn/Passkey Security Model

### Registration Flow
1. **Platform Authenticator Detection**: Verify biometric availability
2. **Credential Creation**: Generate public/private key pair on secure hardware
3. **Key Wrapping**: Encrypt Master Key with WebAuthn-derived key
4. **Local Storage**: Store wrapped key in IndexedDB (not sensitive alone)

### Authentication Flow
1. **Challenge Generation**: Create cryptographically random challenge
2. **Biometric Verification**: User authenticates with fingerprint/Face ID
3. **Signature Generation**: Secure hardware signs challenge
4. **Key Derivation**: Derive decryption key from signature + authenticator data
5. **Master Key Unwrapping**: Decrypt stored wrapped Master Key
6. **Vault Unlock**: Use unwrapped Master Key for vault decryption

### WebAuthn Security Benefits
- **Hardware-Backed Security**: Private keys stored in secure enclaves
- **Phishing Resistance**: Origin-bound credentials prevent attacks
- **Replay Protection**: Challenge-response prevents replay attacks
- **No Secret Transmission**: Private key never leaves secure hardware

## Threat Model & Attack Resistance

### Server Compromise Scenarios

#### Complete Database Breach
**Attack**: Malicious actor gains full database access
**Protection**: 
- All vault data is encrypted with user-specific keys
- Master Passwords never transmitted or stored
- Salt values are not secret (required for legitimate decryption)
- Even with salt, Argon2id makes brute force computationally infeasible

#### Malicious Administrator
**Attack**: Rogue admin attempts to access user data
**Protection**:
- Zero-knowledge architecture prevents any plaintext access
- Server code cannot decrypt vault data even with modifications
- Client-side verification of server responses

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
**Attack**: Network traffic interception
**Protection**:
- HTTPS enforced for all communications
- Only encrypted blobs transmitted over network
- No sensitive keys or passwords in network traffic
- Certificate pinning recommended for production

### Client-Side Attack Vectors

#### Browser Malware/Extensions
**Risk**: Malicious code running in browser context
**Mitigations**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external dependencies
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- WebAssembly isolation for cryptographic operations

#### Physical Device Access
**Risk**: Unauthorized device access while vault unlocked
**Mitigations**:
- Auto-lock timer functionality
- Clear Master Key from memory on inactivity
- WebAuthn requires fresh biometric verification
- Clipboard auto-clear prevents password persistence

### Cryptographic Attack Resistance

#### Quantum Computing Threats
**Analysis**: 
- Argon2id: Quantum-resistant (not based on factorization)
- XChaCha20: Believed quantum-resistant (symmetric cryptography)
- Key Length: 256-bit keys require 2^128 quantum operations

#### Side-Channel Attacks
**Protections**:
- Constant-time cryptographic implementations
- Memory clearing after sensitive operations
- libsodium provides timing-attack resistant primitives
